"Powerline â€“ Eye To Eye (A Goofy Movie) Lyrics

Yeah yeah!
Yeah yeah!

Got myself a notion
One I know you'll understand
Set the world in motion
By reaching out for each other's hands

Maybe we'll discover
What we should've known all along (yeah)
One way or another
Together's where we both belong

[Chorus:]
If we listen to each other's hearts
We'll find we're never too far apart
& Maybe love is the reason why
For the 1st time ever we're seeing it eye to eye

If a wall should come between us
Too high to climb
Too hard to break through
I know that love will lead us
& Find a way to bring me to you

So don't be in a hurry
Think before you count us out (oohh)
You don't have to worry
I won't ever let you down
Nothing's gonna stop us now

[Chorus:]

If you're ever lonely stop!
You don't have to be
After all this slowly
I'll be there for just you & me
Take a look inside & see

[Chorus: X2]"
